# Matrix Calculator
A simple console matrix calculator for Windows OS that can perform basic matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication and matrix multiplication.

Purpose of this project is to effectively manage user-program interaction while providing useful functionality. 

## How to use

You will have to compile the C++ code to use the calculator. The easiest way to do that is to open the `main.cpp` file in your preffered IDE, for example [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/), and press `Build and run` (or F9) button on the toolbar. The `MatrixCalculatorClass.h` and `MatrixCalculatorClass.cpp` files need to be located within the same folder as `main.cpp` file for the compilation to be sucessful.
